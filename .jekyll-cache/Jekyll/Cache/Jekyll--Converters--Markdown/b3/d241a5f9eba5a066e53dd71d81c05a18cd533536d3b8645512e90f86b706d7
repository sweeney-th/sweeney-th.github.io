I"<p>Hello Everyone!</p>

<p>I would like to wish everyone a happy MLK day. It isn’t much, but as an act of respect and commemoration, I though I would share an example of how a beautiful speech can, with relative ease, be turned into a striking visual. We will, of course, be working with the monolithic “I Have a Dream” speech.</p>

<p>I used the R programming language for this, as I have worked more extensively with text with it than Python, and don’t use it as often and want to keep up my skills. If you’d like to see the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YQv88cp.png">rundown</a>, here is the <a href="http://pythoninthewyld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workbook.html">workbook</a>, if not, the final product is below!</p>

<p>Enjoy, and once again, happy Martin Luther King day!</p>
