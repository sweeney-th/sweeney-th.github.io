During a recent differential gene expression analysis I had a few issues converge in such a way that the code would run fine from top to bottom but would silently compromise the analysis and produce bogus results. Essentially it was a combination of a bugged error message in a package I was using, a bad row in an input file I was given, and some weird behavior of R (and of course, my initial carelessness in not noticing sooner). I caught this issues with some included QC functions.

It seemed plausible that these issues could join forces to trip people up now and then, so I figured I would document it in case people wanted to keep an eye out for it.

If you're not interested in this sort of analysis but use R, there is still a short takeaway summarized here:

<code> > x <- c("1", "10", "100") </code><br>
<code> > x </code><br>
<code> [1] "1"   "10"  "100" </code><br>
<code> > x <- as.factor(x) </code><br>
<code> > x </code><br>
<code> [1] 1   10  100 </code><br>
<code> Levels: 1 10 100 </code><br>
<code> > x <- as.integer(x) </code><br>
<code> > x </code><br>
<code> [1] 1 2 3 </code><br>
<code> > # also happens with numerics </code><br>
