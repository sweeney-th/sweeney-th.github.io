Hello all!

I did a project for a data science class in which I classified tweets as being from @realDonaldTrump vs @HillaryClinton. I found a dataset on this on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/clinton-trump-tweets). Because words and context trip up even the most clever programs on occasion, I decided to see if I could write and entirely numerical classifier. It read length of words, average words per sentence, that sort of thing. I wrote a Python function that engineers these features and a script to implement it that adds them to the original dataset. Below is the video:
