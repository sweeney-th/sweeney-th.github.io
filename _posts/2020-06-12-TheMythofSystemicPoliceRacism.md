title: Video - "The Myth of Systemic Police Racism" is full of statistical and journalistic errors

A recent op-ed that ran in the Wall Street Journal contains numerous severe statistical and journalistic errors and makes an enormous claim which is fails to defend. I've created a YouTube video showing my research, explaining the errors, and placing them in context.


1) The piece relies heavily on research about police shootings *specifically* to make claims about police *generally*.
    This ignores literally every other way police can use force. 


2) The piece cites a study which prompted two follow-up papers that found errors and contradictory results,
    and in parts actually contradicts the claim the author is trying to make anyway.


3) The piece also cites well-known research out of context which actually contradicts their claim when taken in context


4) The author appears to fabricate a quote to make the piece sound more definitive.
