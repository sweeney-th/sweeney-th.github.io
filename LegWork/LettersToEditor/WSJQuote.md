Heather Mac Donald presents the following quote in a recent Op-ed[1] on police racism, stating the authors of heavily criticized study[2] find:
 
   “no significant evidence of antiblack disparity in the likelihood of being fatally shot by police”
 
This quote is not from Johnson et al, as she implies it is, but from a preprint[3] reply to a letter demonstrating problems with the study’s methodology. It appears only in the draft, not in the published work[4]. Mac Donald uses the version from before peer review, uploaded to a server August 2019, despite the fact that a peer reviewed, published version of the letter was available in January of 2020, months ahead of her publication on June 2. Mac Donald recently reaffirmed that she "quoted the PNAS article’s conclusion verbatim"[5], apparently unaware that it is not in the paper.
 
Mac Donald refers to published work, provides a link to it, and then presents a quote that is not from a peer reviewed publication and from a different piece entirely. This is, at best, a notable lapse in diligence. At worst it's intellectual sleight-of-hand, invoking rigor and credibility but slipping in something unproven instead. This is one of several instances of careless or misleading work by Mac Donald[6], and her work should be fact checked more diligently before publication.
