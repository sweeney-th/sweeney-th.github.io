I"W<p>A recent op-ed that ran in the Wall Street Journal contains numerous severe statistical and journalistic errors and makes an enormous claim which is fails to defend. Iâ€™ve created a YouTube video showing my research, explaining the errors, and placing them in context.</p>

<p>1) The piece relies heavily on research about police shootings <em>specifically</em> to make claims about police <em>generally</em>.
    This ignores literally every other way police can use force.</p>

<p>2) The piece cites a study which prompted two follow-up papers that found errors and contradictory results,
    and in parts actually contradicts the claim the author is trying to make anyway.</p>

<p>3) The piece also cites well-known research out of context which actually contradicts their claim when taken in context</p>

<p>4) The author appears to fabricate a quote to make the piece sound more definitive.</p>
