A few years ago, I wrote an [MLK day post](https://pythoninthewyld.com/2018/01/16/in-honor-of-mlk-i-have-a-dream-wordcloud-example-in-r/) on creating a wordcloud from the legendary "I Have a Dream" speech. I thought I would continue the tradition by doing another for Letter From Birmingham Jail. The code is available [here](https://github.com/sweeney-th/PITW/tree/master/Posts/MLK). It's a simple project, but can be a compelling way to quickly highlight themes from the original text to pique the interest of readers.
